### *Your bureaucracy in the reach of one sentence.*

## The Vision That Started It All

Imagine a world where filling out PDFs, navigating endless forms, and completing digital processes doesn't require hours of your time.

**You just ask.**

An AI partner that understands what you need, navigates the web autonomously, and walks you through each step—automatically, securely, and tailored to you.

This isn't just another AI tool.  
**It's a paradigm shift in how humans interact with bureaucracy.**

And it was born in 24 hours.

## 🏆 First Place — HUJI 25 Hackathon

**The Challenge:** Build something that matters  
**The Timeline:** 25 sleepless hours  
**The Result:** 1st place + semester scholarship to Hebrew University of Jerusalem

But here's the real story—it's not about the code we wrote.  
It's about the **leadership philosophy** that made it possible.

## The Moment of Truth: Leading vs. Coding

When our team walked into that hackathon, I had two paths:

**Path A:** Dive deep into backend infrastructure, spend 2/3 of the time perfecting agents and architecture—do what I'm *technically* capable of.

**Path B:** Step back and ask: *What does this team actually need from me?*

I looked around:
- ✅ A frontend genius who could bring any design to life
- ✅ A backend wizard who lived and breathed infrastructure
- ❌ No Product Manager
- ❌ No storyteller
- ❌ No one driving the vision forward

**So I made the hardest decision: I stopped coding and started leading.**

## The Strategy Behind the Win

### 🎯 Vision Over Vanity

Every feature discussion, I asked one question:  
*"Is this helping the vision? Or just making the AI cooler?"*

We weren't building a research paper.  
We were building an **MVP that solves real pain.**

### 🧩 Playing to Strengths

I knew where we were unstoppable.  
I knew where we were vulnerable.  
And I filled the gaps—not with more code, but with **clarity, direction, and storytelling.**

### 🎤 The Pitch That Changed Everything

When the judges approached our table, something clicked.

I remembered AppsFlyer.  
I remembered MEET, Year 3 summer.  
My first-ever startup pitch with a bi-national team of 10.

It was like *Karate Kid*—all those "practice sessions" I didn't realize were training me for this exact moment.

**"Welcome to Shaman. Your bureaucracy in the reach of one sentence…"**

The judges leaned in.  
We had them.

## 💡 What I Learned (And Why It Matters)

### Technical Excellence ≠ Leadership Excellence

In tech, we glorify the "10x engineer."  
But the real magic happens when you know **when to step back** and ask:

> *"What can I bring to this table that no one else can?"*

For me, that wasn't perfect React components.  
It was:
- **Pattern recognition** across teams and products
- **Strategic storytelling** that made people *feel* the vision
- **Tactical decision-making** under extreme time pressure
- **Team orchestration** that let everyone play to their superpowers

### The Strength of Knowing Your Role

A tech leader isn't always the most technical person in the room.  
Sometimes, leadership means:
- Saying "no" to features that distract from the core vision
- Creating space for others to shine in their expertise
- Being the glue that holds chaos together
- Remembering that **teamwork > hero work**

## 🚀 What We Built

**Shaman** is an AI-powered bureaucracy navigator that:

- 🤖 Interprets natural language requests ("I need to file my taxes")
- 🌐 Autonomously navigates government and corporate websites
- 📋 Fills forms, uploads documents, and completes multi-step processes
- 🔒 Maintains security and privacy throughout
- 👁️ Shows you every step transparently—you're always in control

### Tech Stack
- **AI/ML:** Custom agent architecture with web navigation capabilities
- **Frontend:** React, real-time UI updates
- **Backend:** Node.js, secure API handling
- **Integration:** Headless browser automation, form recognition

But honestly? The tech stack isn't what made us win.  
**The vision, the pitch, and the teamwork did.**

## 🙏 Gratitude & Reflection

To everyone at **MEET** who taught me that leadership isn't taught—it's *practiced*:

Those late nights debugging APIs.  
Those wild debates over font sizes.  
Those moments when I pitched ideas that seemed crazy.

**You were training me for this.**

When that hackathon clock started, I didn't hesitate.  
I felt **ready. Grounded. Home.**

Because I'd been here before—in smaller rooms, with quieter stakes, building the muscles I'd need when it really counted.

## 🎯 What's Next

This is just the beginning.

Shaman proved a concept in 24 hours.  
Now we're taking it further:
- Expanding form recognition across industries
- Building enterprise partnerships
- Scaling the agent architecture
- Making bureaucracy obsolete, one form at a time

But more than that?  
I'm taking this lesson with me everywhere:

**The best contribution you can make isn't always the most technical one.**  
**Sometimes, it's knowing when to lead, when to listen, and when to let others shine.**

---

*"A tech leader isn't always the most technical one."*

*Built in 24 hours. Refined through years of practice. Driven by a vision of what technology should do: make life simpler, not harder.*
